If the given\nport has not previously been configured as a gyro, then this function starts\na 1300ms calibration period.\n\nIt is highly recommended that an ADIGyro object be created in initialize()\nwhen the robot is stationary to ensure proper calibration. If an ADIGyro\nobject is declared at the global scope, a hardcoded 1300ms delay at the\nbeginning of initialize will be necessary to ensure that the gyro's\nreturned values are correct at the beginning of autonomous/opcontrol.\n\nThis function uses the following values of errno when an error state is\nreached:\nENXIO - Either the ADI port value or the smart port value is not within its\n\t   valid range (ADI port: 1-8, 'a'-'h', or 'A'-'H'; smart port: 1-21).\n\n\\param port_pair\n       The pair of the smart port number (from 1-22) and the\n \t  ADI port number (from 1-8, 'a'-'h', 'A'-'H') to configure\n\\param multiplier\n       A scalar value that will be multiplied by the gyro heading value\n       supplied by the ADI","declarations":[{"spell":"631:2-631:9|22|2|1","param_spellings":["631:30-631:39","631:48-631:58"]}],"declaring_type":22,"bases":[],"derived":[],"vars":[],"uses":[],"callees":[]},{"id":30,"usr":17994133325688680133,"detailed_name":"double pros::ADIGyro::get_value() const","short_name_offset":22,"short_name_size":9,"kind":6,"storage":1,"hover":"","comments":"\nGets the current gyro angle in tenths of a degree.
